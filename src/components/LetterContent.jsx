I love you. Honestly, deeply, and with everything I have. You mean more to me than I could ever explain in words. Youâ€™re not just someone I care aboutâ€”youâ€™re the most important person in my life.

No matter what happens, I want you to know this: I canâ€™t leave you. I wonâ€™t. Youâ€™re a part of me now, and I canâ€™t imagine life without you. You matter to me more than I even matter to myself.

You make my world better just by being in it. Your smile, your laugh, the way you areâ€”it all means everything to me. And I feel lucky every day that I get to love you.

Even if times get tough, or if we ever face problems, Iâ€™m not going anywhere. Iâ€™m here. Always.`;
